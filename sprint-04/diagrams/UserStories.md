As an Admin:
* I want escalated privileges so I can perform all the tasks of a regular user while keeping a check on the website.
* I want to be able to remove a user from the platform so if somebody breaks community guidelines, they can be removed.
* I want to be able to delete an item or post so I can eliminate anything that doesn't match the website criteria.
* I want to be able to add/remove other users as admin users so we can always have trustworthy people in the admin positions.


Everything is doable in our site and an admin user can add or delete post with also the option to add the users as well. The admin user has all the access as a normal user will do. On the second point which is saying about search we won’t have a search button it self but we will have a pretty self explanatory site with product page, home page and about page. 

As a Buyer:
* I want to be able to login on the website. So that I have access for buyer student.
* I want to be able to search on the webpage. So that I can find necessary information and easily navigate to other pages.
* I want to be able to submit feedback (karma). So that all other users can view my feedback and decide whether to buy the product or not.
* I want to be able to view feedback (karma) that other users give to a product. So that, I can determine whether to buy it or not.
* I want to be able to place a custom product request. So that I can get an item by providing the details in case the item is currently not listed.
* I want to be able to navigate from the home page directly to my wish-list. So that I can review the items later on and contact the sellers.
* I want to be able to know who the seller is. So that I can ask questions via chat or comments.
* I want to be able to view seller information. So that I can make an offer if I am interested in buying the particular item.

Everything is almost on our site except the karma portion as that is something we will be adding to the site with the chat features so they can give feedback and also communicate with each other through comments or personal chat. Everything else is on our site already.

* I want to be able to change user credentials on the website. So that I can change my password and id in case it is hacked or forgotten .
* I want to be able to view and change user details on the website e.g., first, and last names and contact details. So that I can change my details in case they are changed.
* I want to be able to view the feedback (karma) from buyers. So that I can improve accordingly or change my items.
