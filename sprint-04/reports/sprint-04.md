### UI/UX Artifacts

Place links and or screenshots to minimum of **4** artifacts here. Artifacts are defined as GitHub commit URL and Project Management Tool Kanban board images (Trello or JIRA).

User stories needs to be included in the *diagrams* folder but **not** included in the report section under UI/UX

### Infrastructure

We were able to successfully complete the IT Operations and Infrastructure tasks in sprint 3 â€“ our virtual machine was split into frontend and backend servers that would automatically build and deploy with all the variables we've chosen to keep local. Upon building, our Django web application and MySQL databases - as indicated in the ERD we created - are also automatically created and become immediately accessible. Therefore, the team member with this role for sprint 4 in turn assisted the UI/UX member and helped develop user stories that would indicate what our goals were for this current sprint as well as the next one.
