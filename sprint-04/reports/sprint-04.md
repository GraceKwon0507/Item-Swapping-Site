# Sprint-04 Written Report

## Team Number 06

* **Hareem Akram** - Project Manager
* **Grace Kwon** - Developer
* **Muhammad Naveed Zahid** - Jr. Developer
* **Cristian Pintor** - UI/UX
* **Rida Tariq** - IT Operations

### UI/UX Artifacts

Place links and or screenshots to minimum of **4** artifacts here. Artifacts are defined as GitHub commit URL and Project Management Tool Kanban board images (Trello or JIRA).

User stories needs to be included in the *diagrams* folder but **not** included in the report section under UI/UX

### Infrastructure

Seeing how sprint 4 was essentially a continuation of sprint 3, our IT Operations and Infrastructure member did not have any tasks to complete since we were able to successfully split our application into two servers, and automate the build and deployment of these said servers. Instead, our IT Operations member assisted with some UI/UX tasks, namely the creation of user stories for our current and next sprints.

### Developer

We fell short on the development front in the last sprint, and were not able to successfully demonstrate the creation of user accounts and posts. This sprint, we rectified that, and users can now sign up on the frontend and use those credentials to log in (previously, only accounts that had been hard coded were able to log in)

### Junior Developer

Place links and or screenshots to minimum of **4** artifacts here.  Artifacts are defined as GitHub commit URL and Project Management Tool Kanban board images (Trello or JIRA).

Place screen shot to image of a minimum of 5 GitHub issues/bugs reported and assigned

### Project Manager

1. Place images of the full User & Admin and/or anonymous story here with annotations of the functioning and the non-functioning portions as necessary (can reuse the artifact created by UI/UX)
1. Include a file  ```install.md``` in the root of the team GitHub Repo detailing all instructions to build and run the functioning parts of your site
1. Verify that all defined minimum goals were met and explain goals that were reached beyond what was defined.  Also explain reasons behind goals that were not met.
1. List any detailed assumptions your team made explaining deliverable context as needed.
