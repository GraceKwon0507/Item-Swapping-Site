##UI/UX Report

## Developer Report
* <b>Frontend: HTML, CSS, React.js</b>
  * HTML & CSS
    * Major players in the overall web design of the final product
  * JavaScript
    * Improves the user experience by taking a static webpage and turning it into a dynamic, interactive one
    * Offers much more in terms of programming beyond aesthetics and ease of use
* <b>Backend: Python</b>
  * High efficiency, stability, and scope of development
  * Great readability: blocks of code can be “inherited” (reused) throughout the program – both reducing clutter and the chances of error
    * Inheritance + Python’s relatively simple syntax => faster development
* <b>Web Framework: Django</b>
  * Extensive libraries and functions that well-equip Python
  * Used at Instagram and Spotify
    * Instagram: primarily for photo management
    * Spotify: overall backend development & data analytics
  * Integrate well with our website's frontend technology
  * Fully capable of being used in the backend development of a website
    * Any features not present in the backend can be added in the frontend and still work seamlessly
  * Extensive frameworks that improve the development experience
    * <b>Our choice: React.js</b>
      * Renders web pages quickly; elements and content are being loaded without a large delay
        * Improves user experience
        * Allows constant update of any dynamic elements that may be present on the website
      * Created by Facebook
        * Now used by Reddit, Notion.so and even Netflix
## IT Infrastructure Report
* <b>OS: Ubuntu</b>
  * Compatible with database like MYSQL
  * Open source OS; we can use it with other services as well
* <b>Database: MySQL</b>
  * Usage
    * Store customer information and log in information
    * Save data that customers upload
* <b>Caching layer: X</b>
  * There won't be a lot of traffic, so it's not needed.
* <b>Additional features: Chat</b>
  * Users can communicate with each other.
