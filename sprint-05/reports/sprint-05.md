This sprint, the UX/UX designer was in charge of ensuring every user was inputting legitimate posts and creating non-test user accounts for demonstration purposes, which was done. Here are some screenshots highlighting our posts and comments, all created by “real” people:

These test users also have their own profiles, such as the one we created for Steve:

Lastly, for additions we made after sprint 3, the main changes in our website design was the inclusion of comment and rating systems. The commenting feature is already demonstrated in the above screenshots, and the karma/rating system works as follows:

Our aim was to work a little more on the CSS of the website to incorporate our school colors into the website design, but unfortunately due to the lack of time and other priorities, were unable to.

For this sprint, I contributed some of the last minute development work into the project, such as adding the image feature for posts as well as comments and a couple other small tasks like footer and sidebar links.

View of comments under a post

View of comment form

View of post with image of product

View post form with title, content and image fields

Infrastructure
We have two IP addresses:
192.168.33.33 serves as our front-end server address which displays all of our Django templates


192.168.33.34 serves as our back-end address where our MariaDB database lives and where all of our migrations from Djnago are passed over in order to create new tables with all of the columns required for a certain functionality like comments or posts




The two scripts that build the servers are:
post_install_django-install-and-configure-webserver.sh
post_install_django-install-and-configure-database.sh

These two scripts install the database and framework used in our web application. Our install.md 

The main external package installed during the VM installation is the Django framework.
